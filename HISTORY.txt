------- Current version
% CSBP_solver version 4.0, november 2013
08/11/13 Jean Barbier
1.) Adding the use of Fourier and Hadamard seeded operators for fast, memory efficient and optimal compresed sensing of real or complex signals.
2.) New demos for fast compressed sensing and real coding through gaussian channel. See Jean Barbier and Florent Krzakala articles on arxiv.
3.) Deletion of useless routines.
4.) New priors and AMP scripts

14/02/14 Jean Barbier
1.) Adding the routines and demo for our Superposition codes scheme (see article)
2.) corrections of some small mistakes

------- Old version
%CSBP_solver version 3.0, february 2013
18/02/13 Jean Barbier
1.) Re-organization of the code with use of classes
2.) Addition of new priors with associated learnings: L1, SparseExponential, SparseConstant
3.) Addition of the AMP-homogeneous form of the algorithm

%CSBP_solver Version 2.0, January 2013
20/01/2013 Pan Zhang: 
1.) Code is re-organized, especially CSBP_Solver.m.
2.) AMP is optimized, now it is much faster than before.
3.) BP is added as an option(just finished, needs tests), set opt.method='BP' to use BP instead of AMP.

16/11/2012 F. Krzakala: Complete changes of the algo (including the
name). We now use the notation from Krzakala et al. arXiv:1206.3953,
J. Stat. Mech. (2012) P08009 Also included are new matrices, priors
and options. So far, the fully-TAP version is not implemented.
